|------|-------------------|
|Legal and civil liberties risks because the protection afforded to a driver’s data depends not on where they travel, but on where the querying state agency is requesting it. |Access and use of ALPR data BEYOND LOCAL STATE ACCESS. Will other states fight for their fourth amenment rights to stricten access duration? 
| Workers are curious too!| In Washington D.C., the Police Complaints Board (PCB) reported that the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) receives ALPR data from external agencies without disclosing which agencies provide it, how long the data is retained, or under what authority the sharing occurs.<sup id="fn2_ref"><a href="#fn1">2</a></sup> |
