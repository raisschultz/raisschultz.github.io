The use of ALPRs has raised several legal questions and concerns regarding privacy, data access, interstate law enforcement, and constitutional rights and protections. 

One issue is the lack of consistent legal standards across states. In some jurisdictions, ALPR data is treated as a public record available through open-records requests, while in others it is explicitly protected as confidential law-enforcement information.<sup id="fn1_ref"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Despite these differences, ALPR systems share data across state lines through vendor networks like Flock’s, meaning that information collected in a state with strong privacy protections may still be accessed by agencies in states with weaker ones. This creates legal and civil liberties risks because the protection afforded to a driver’s data depends not on where they travel, but on where the querying agency is located.

Another issue is regarding the transparency in the access and use of ALPR data. In Washington D.C., the Police Complaints Board (PCB) reported that the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) receives ALPR data from external agencies without disclosing which agencies provide it, how long the data is retained, or under what authority the sharing occurs.<sup id="fn2_ref"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Inconsistent internal documentation makes it even harder for oversight bodies and the public to understand just how far and fast ALPR data is spread and used. Gaps in transparency undermine public trust in law enforcement institutions, and also heighten the risk and possibility of misuse. 

Misuses of ALPR databases is another issue. Numerous investigations show that some officers have exploited confidential law-enforcement systems to search information about romantic partners, neighbors, business associates, journalists, and others for non-official purposes.<sup id="fn3_ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Any single officer in any law enforcement agency around the nation can access highly sensitive data regarding travel and movement histories of individuals with minimal oversight. The potential for misuse goes further than officers using it for personal gain, ALPR data could also be used by local municipalities to track and identify individuals traveling to abortion clinics from states where abortion is illegal, exposing them to potential civil or criminal liabilities back home in states that penalize such travel.<sup id="fn3_ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>

ALPRs also raise questions under the Fourth Amendment. Courts generally hold that license plates are publicly visible and that their observation does not constitute a search.<sup id="fn4_ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> As a result, most legal challenges have focused not on the act of scanning plates, but on the collection and long-term querying of ALPR databases. While no federal appellate court has held that access to ALPR databases amounts to a Fourth Amendment search, several trial courts have cautioned that warrantless, extended surveillance of a person’s movements could violate constitutional protections in certain circumstances.<sup id="fn4_ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Nonetheless, recent rulings like the Virginia Court of Appeals decision upholding the constitutionality of Flock’s ALPR systems demonstrate currently ALPR systems remain permissible and do not constitute unreasonable searches in Virginia.<sup id="fn5_ref"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>
