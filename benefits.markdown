Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) provide several benefits to law enforcement agencies and federal authorities. By automating what officers previously had to do manually and be present to capture, ALPRs allow officers to work faster, and more efficiently. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ALPR systems capture plate numbers and vehicle data in real time and instantly compare them against criminal databases, speeding up investigations and improve officer’s abilities to identify vehicles associated with theft, trafficking and other illegal activity.<sup>1</sup> The DHS also states that the adoption of ALPR technology for federal agencies is necessary because it captures data that officers and agents could not reliably capture on their own; on high volume roadways and ports of entry, and is a key tool for targeted and efficient public safety.<sup>1</sup>

At the community level, ALPRs can reduce car thefts and support responses to Amber and Silver alerts and other missing persons cases. When deployed with clear rules and oversight, the ACLU notes that ALPRs can serve legitimate public safety goals by enabling law enforcement to recover stolen cars, locate suspects, and reduce investigative time in cases where minutes or hours matter.<sup>2</sup> For smaller or understaffed police departments, ALPR systems like Flock’s function as a force multiplier that allows officers to focus on other aspects of policing while still taking care of traffic monitoring.

Flock Safety claims their ALPRs are privacy-conscious tools because they are designed to capture vehicle information rather than personal identifiers such as faces. Flock asserts that its systems help communities address crime patterns through targeted, vehicle-based data rather than broad personal surveillance, and that limited retention periods and audit logs keep data use focused on public safety outcomes.<sup>3</sup> ALPRs are marketed as technologies that could enhance community security and investigative efficiency without requiring invasive data collection about individuals. 

At the federal level, ALPRs are now being used to support border management and national security. For agencies like CBP and ICE, access to ALPR networks like Flock’s are essential tools that automate routine tasks, streamline enforcement operations, increase officer efficiency and improve situational awareness and safety efforts across the nation.<sup>1</sup>
