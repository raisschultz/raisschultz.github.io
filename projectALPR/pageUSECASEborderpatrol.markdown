Federal agencies such as Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have begun to utilize ALPR technology and Flock’s centralized databases for purposes beyond community tools for public safety. This use case shows how ALPRs have begun to function as part of a national surveillance network used by the government for immigration and border control, rather than just finding a stolen vehicle.
Unlike Flock’s community ALPR deployments, which are justified and used as crime-prevention tools in specific communities and law enforcement jurisdictions, federal agency use operates at a national scale. Vehicle-location data is pulled from a broad network of systems, including private ALPR vendors, local police departments, ports of entry, and highway checkpoints. This interconnected surveillance system enabled by ALPR technology allows CBP and ICE to track vehicle movements far from the border and over large periods of time.

An investigation by the Associated Press (AP) showed the extent to which CBP and ICE have made use of ALPR technology and turned them into a nationwide mass surveillance program. Through government-run cameras, port-of-entry systems, and contracts with private ALPR companies like Flock Safety, federal agencies monitor and store the travel patterns of millions of vehicles across dozens of states.<sup id="fn1_ref"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
	
From the AP and ACLU, using ALPR technology: 

* Federal agents can track vehicles hundreds of miles inland, far from any border crossing.<sup id="fn1_ref"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>


* ICE uses ALPR data to identify, locate, and investigate individuals for immigration enforcement.<sup id="fn1_ref"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>


* Data from Flock Safety and other commercial ALPR companies feeds into federal systems through formal contracts.<sup id="fn2_ref"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defends the use of ALPRs and expansion of ALPR networks as necessary for border management and national security in their Privacy Impact Assessment for the use of License Plate Reader technology by CBP. Per the DHS, ALPR technology speeds up processing at ports of entry, helps identify vehicles associated with smuggling and trafficking, increases efficiency of federal officers, and supports ongoing investigations, which in turn increase public safety and national security.<sup id="fn3_ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Additionally, the DHS states that federal agency use of ALPRs does not capture facial recognition data, and that license plates are publicly visible and there is no expectation of privacy regarding that data.<sup id="fn3_ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>

The University of Michigan’s Public Policy program notes that once local ALPR data enters vendor networks, communities often have little real control over how it is later accessed by federal agencies.<sup id="fn4_ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> The federal use of ALPRs represents not just an increase in scale but a shift in the purpose that ALPR technology by companies like Flock was originally developed for; from local crime deterrence to large-scale immigration enforcement and national security operations.
