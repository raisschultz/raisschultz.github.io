# The Chilling of Civil Rights and Liberties

From a civil liberties and rights-based ethical standpoint, Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) represent a form of surveillance that conflicts with fundamental human rights to privacy, freedom of movement, and freedom of association. This ethical perspective is grounded in deontological ethics, which holds that certain rights and moral duties exist independently of outcomes, and cannot be overridden simply because a policy is effective or useful.<sup id="fn1_ref"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> From this viewpoint, ALPRs are ethically problematic not because they fail or succeed in reducing crime, but because they undermine rights that individuals are inherently entitled to. The right to privacy, liberty, and freedom from arbitrary interference are recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<sup id="fn2_ref"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

Individuals have a right not to be tracked, monitored, or recorded by the government as they engage in everyday, routine activities. On the GMU Fairfax campus, where 23 Flock cameras monitor vehicles, students and community members have, perhaps unknowingly, encountered this technology.. The anti-Flock stickers posted around campus show that people that are aware are feeling like they are under mass surveillance by the Flock ALPR system.

A primary concern from the civil liberties focused ethical perspective is that ALPRs generate detailed logs of ordinary people’s movements without their awareness or consent. As the ACLU notes, surveillance that continuously collects and shares location data can chill lawful behavior, restrict democratic participation, and expose vulnerable populations to government scrutiny.<sup id="fn3_ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> 

Additionally, this use of ALPRs disproportionately harms marginalized and vulnerable communities further. Immigration enforcement through contracts nationwide with ALPR providers like Flock enables ICE and CBP to track, monitor and identify people using data intended and collected for local policing purposes for unrelated civil and federal government immigration operations. For immigrants and mixed-status families, the knowledge that routine travel can result in them being targeted  undermines their freedom of movement and sense of safety. From the civil liberties ethical perspective, this raises concerns about privacy, fairness, discrimination, and due process.

There is the panopticon effect with surveillance systems: when people believe that they could be being monitored, even if no one is actively watching them at that moment, they will self-censor and alter their natural behavior.<sup id="fn4_ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup><sup id="fn5_ref"><a href="#fn5">,5</a></sup>
 ALPRs extend this effect across cities and communities, creating a modern, nationwide panopticon in which the possibility of constant observation may pressure individuals to avoid certain locations, modify routines, or disengage from normal civic or political activity. 

ACLU investigations show that vendor networks like Flock’s enable wider sharing of ALPR data than many residents or local officials realize. This lack of transparency violates core civil-liberties principles that government surveillance must be accountable to the public it governs.<sup id="fn6_ref"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>
From a civil rights and liberties based deontological perspective, ALPRs are not just public safety tools. In their current use, they function as surveillance infrastructure that undermines autonomy, chills lawful behavior, disproportionately affects marginalized groups, and weakens the trust on which democratic societies depend.
