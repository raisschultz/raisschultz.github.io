From the ethical perspective of the government, and law enforcement, ALPRs are justified as necessary tools that increase efficiency, and advance public safety and national security. This ethical perspective is grounded in the idea that the state has an ethical duty to prevent crime and maintain social order.<sup>1</sup> The use of more efficient tools like ALPRs helps them fulfill their responsibility to the public. 

This ethical framing is rooted in utilitarian reasoning, which evaluates actions based on their outcomes and prioritizes what produces the greatest overall benefit for society.<sup>2</sup> With this perspective, ALPRs are ethically acceptable because they reduce crime, enhance investigative capabilities, and enable faster, more accurate identification of vehicles associated with theft, trafficking, smuggling, and other serious criminal activity. Any intrusion into personal privacy is considered minimal compared to the increases in public safety these systems might provide.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) describes ALPRs as operationally essential technologies that simply automate tasks officers have always performed manually.<sup>3</sup> Capturing license plates automatically is simply digitization of information that is already publicly visible on the roads. Automating this process is an efficiency upgrade that strengthens the government’s capacity to protect communities. 

ALPRs and their databases are force multipliers for local law enforcement that allow them to focus on tasks and parts of the job that demand real human work, like investigations, community engagement, and emergencies. This logic can be extended onto the national level. CBP and ICE argue that access to nationwide ALPR networks like Flock’s helps them identify vehicles connected to crime and trafficking, increasing officer safety and efficiency, aiding in what these organizations see as their ethical duty; public and national security.<sup>4</sup> 

From the ethical perspective of law enforcement agencies and the government, the use of ALPR technologies is necessary, and justified. ALPRs and networks like Flock’s contribute to more secure communities and a more secure nation, which fulfills the government's obligation to protect its population.
