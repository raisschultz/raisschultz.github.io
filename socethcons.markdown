The expansion in use of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) has raised social and ethical concerns related to privacy, civil liberties, and behavioral impacts due to widespread surveillance. Some of these concerns over mass surveillance and fears over the use of ALPR data against marginalized and vulnerable communities by federal authorities have led to residents in cities like Austin, Texas pushing their local governments to cancel contracts with Flock.<sup id="fn1_ref"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

One of the primary ethical concerns is that ALPRs generate detailed records of the movements of ordinary people who are not suspected of any crime. These systems log when and where cars travel, without public awareness or real consent. According to the ACLU, this mass collection includes trips to workplaces, schools, medical offices, religious centers, and political meetings, which create comprehensive maps of individual behavior that can be stored and shared across jurisdictions.<sup id="fn2_ref"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The example of Bridgewater, Virginia revealed how local surveillance feeds into a national surveillance network when the small town’s ALPR data was queried nearly seven million times by thousands of agencies nationwide.<sup id="fn3_ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>

The potential use of ALPR data by federal agencies poses risks towards vulnerable, marginalized, and targeted communities. Immigrant communities have to worry that local ALPR data, which is uploaded to central databases like Flock’s, can then be accessed by the federal agencies that have contracts with Flock, like ICE.<sup id="fn4_ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> The implication of ALPR technology is that routine travel could expose individuals to immigration enforcement, which in turn discourages those populations from seeking services, integrating with communities, and just having the freedom to travel freely. 

The “panopticon effect” is a concept derived from a prison design, and expanded on by Michael Foucault.<sup id="fn5_ref"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> In a panopticon, the possibility of being observed - whether or not one truly is being observed - shapes the behavior of the observee.

This effect can compel people to self regulate, alter their routines, and avoid and reduce behaviors they fear could be misinterpreted by the possible observer.<sup id="fn6_ref"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Civil liberty scholars describe this as the “chilling effect”, where surveillance deters lawful activities like attending protests, visiting health services (like an abortion clinic), and participating in political organizations.

When applied to ALPRs, which capture and store travel data, the panopticon effect shows how lawful residents may adjust their behavior out of fear that their movements are being tracked, analyzed, or being used against them.

The rapid spread, development and expansion in use of ALPR technology only intensifies these concerns and their importance. Flock and other ALPR vendors in the space are beginning to incorporate AI-powered systems into their networks and tools, and as the cost of this technology falls, the rate of adoption and use will only increase.<sup id="fn7_ref"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> The easy deployment and lack of requirements regarding transparency of ALPR systems like Flock’s can only normalize routine mass surveillance, which in turn amplifies risks of profiling, misuse of data, and targeting of individuals. The effects of behavioral chilling, incursions into privacy, and impact on vulnerable and marginalized groups in society are serious ethical concerns for society.
