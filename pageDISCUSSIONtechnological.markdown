|A centralized ALPR database also increases the opportunities for internal misuse of the system.|Law enforcement officers have historically abused access to confidential systems to monitor romantic partners, neighbours, families and others for non-policing, personal reasons.<sup id="fn2_ref"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> .
| NATIONAL REACH | Because ALPR networks allow searches across thousands of jurisdictions, a single officer’s misconduct could have national reach. The possibility of an officer using an ALPR system to stalk an ex’s movements on the other side of the country is very real.
