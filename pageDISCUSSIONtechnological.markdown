The technological design of ALPRs, their systems, and databases have some concerns, especially as the use of ALPR networks like Flock’s have expanded from local community policing to large federal agencies. ALPR vendors like Flock store the vehicle-movement data in a centralized cloud platform that is accessible to thousands of law enforcement agencies and entities.<sup id="fn1_ref"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

On one hand, this enables easy and fast searches across jurisdictions, it also concentrates sensitive data within a single system. A data breach would expose detailed information about where millions of people live, work, worship, and seek medical care. Civil liberties experts warn that any infrastructure storing large-scale location data becomes a high-value target for cyberattacks.<sup id="fn2_ref"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

A centralized ALPR database also increases the opportunities for internal misuse of the system. Law enforcement officers have historically abused access to confidential systems to monitor romantic partners, neighbours, families and others for non-policing, personal reasons.<sup id="fn3_ref"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Because ALPR networks allow searches across thousands of jurisdictions, a single officer’s misconduct could have national reach. The possibility of an officer using an ALPR system to stalk an ex’s movements on the other side of the country is very real. 

These concerns are heightened when ALPR systems are incorporated into federal agencies. Federal use of networks like Flock’s is very different from use in cities or communities, it covers larger geographical areas, pulls from and compiles data from a variety of sources, and retains the data for longer periods of time.<sup id="fn4_ref"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>

A final technological implication with ALPR technology is the future integration of AI-powered systems, in order to lower costs and increase the efficiency of the systems.<sup id="fn5_ref"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> Automated systems could issue citations or flag “suspicious” travel without human oversight.<sup id="fn5_ref"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> This introduces technical risks such as algorithmic errors, false positives, and biased outcomes, and raises more ethical and legal questions about due process when decisions are made by software rather than officers.
